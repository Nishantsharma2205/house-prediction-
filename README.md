🏠 Task  Completed – House Price Prediction

🔧 Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
📊 Built and trained a regression model to predict house prices based on features like size, number of rooms, and location.
📈 Evaluated the model using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to measure prediction accuracy.

✅ Key Learnings:

Data preprocessing & one-hot encoding for categorical variables

Splitting data into training/testing sets

Model training and performance evaluation

📁 Dataset used: Custom real estate dataset with multiple housing features

🚀 This project enhanced my understanding of linear regression and model evaluation in real-world scenarios.
